        <h2>2. Unlimited Money: Say Goodbye to Grinding</h2>

        <h2>3. All Bikes Unlocked: Ride Your Dream Machine</h2>

        <h2>4. Endless Excitement: No Two Rides Are the Same</h2>
        <p>One of the standout features of <span class="highlight">Traffic Rider</span> is its endless mode. Unlike traditional racing games where you have a set number of levels or tracks, endless mode lets you ride as far as you can without any limits.

With over 100 missions to complete, there’s never a dull moment. Each mission comes with its own set of challenges, from overtaking a certain number of vehicles to completing a race within a time limit.</p>
        <p>The career mode is designed to keep you engaged and motivated. As you progress, you’ll unlock new bikes, upgrades, and even special abilities that give you an edge on the road. It’s a rewarding experience that makes you feel like you’re actually building a career as a professional racer.</p>

        <h2>6. Realistic Sound Effects: Hear the Roar of the Engine</h2>
        <p>Graphics aren’t the only thing that makes <span class="highlight">Traffic Rider</span> feel real—the sound design is equally impressive. The roar of the engine, the screech of tires, and the honking of horns all contribute to an immersive audio experience.</p>
        <p>Each bike has its own distinct engine sound, so you can tell whether you’re riding a high-performance sports bike or a rugged cruiser just by listening. The sound effects add an extra layer of excitement to the game, making every ride feel like a cinematic experience.</p>

        <h2>7. Customizable Controls: Play Your Way</h2>
        <p>Not everyone plays games the same way, and <span class="highlight">Traffic Rider</span> understands that. The game offers fully customizable controls, so you can set it up however you like. Whether you prefer tilt controls, touch controls, or a combination of both, you can tailor the game to suit your playstyle.</p>
        <p>This level of customization ensures that the game is accessible to players of all skill levels. Beginners can start with simpler controls and gradually switch to more advanced setups as they get better. It’s a small feature that makes a big difference.</p>

        <h2>8. Frequent Updates: Always Something New</h2>
        <p>The developers of <span class="highlight">Traffic Rider</span> are constantly working to improve the game and add new content. From new bikes and tracks to special events and challenges, there’s always something to look forward to. These updates keep the game fresh and exciting, so you’ll never run out of things to do.</p>

        <h2>9. No Annoying Ads: Uninterrupted Fun</h2>
        <p>Let’s be honest—ads can ruin the fun of any game. But with <span class="highlight">Traffic Rider’s</span> premium features, you can say goodbye to those pesky interruptions. No more waiting 30 seconds to continue your ride or being forced to watch ads to earn rewards.</p>
        <p>The game is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience from start to finish. You can focus on what really matters—racing your heart out and having a blast.</p>

        <h2>10. A Game That Respects Your Time</h2>
